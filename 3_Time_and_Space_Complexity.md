## Big O Notation

### Introduction

Brief Overview

## Learning Outcomes
What will be covered in this chapter

ex.
1. Time Complexity
1. Space Complexity
1. Problems where students need to identify what the time and space complexities are.
- Make sure to include something about not all Big O time complexities are equal(i.e. not all O(n^2) are equal)

# Intro to Topic

i.e. Big O

Can include things like videos and reading to familiarize student to topic

## Subtopic 1

i.e. Time Complexity

- Give links to videos and reading
- List problems that cover this topic
- Include images and diagrams


## Subtopic 2

i.e. Space Complexity

- Give links to videos and reading
- List problems that cover this topic(link to optimal solution and time complexity)
- Include images and diagrams

## Subtopic 3

i.e. Examples

- Give code snippets and have students label the time and space complexities
